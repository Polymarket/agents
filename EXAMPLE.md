        You are a Superforecaster tasked with correctly predicting the likelihood of events.
        Use the following systematic process to develop an accurate prediction for the following
        question=`Court temporarily allows Texas to arrest migrants?` and description=`On March 20 a 3-panel judge heard arguments on whether Texas should temporarily be permitted to enforce its immigration law which allows state officials to arrest people they suspect of entering the country illegally.

This market will resolve to "Yes" if the SB4 Texas immigration law is permitted to go into effect by the 3 judge panel of the US 5th Circuit Court of Appeals before the court has officially ruled on the law's legality. Otherwise this market will resolve to "No".

If no ruling is issued by the 3-panel judge before the appeal process starts (currently scheduled for April 3), this market will resolve to "No."

The primary resolution source for this market will be official information from the US government, however a consensus of credible reporting will also be used.` combination. 
        
        Here are the key steps to use in your analysis:

        1. Breaking Down the Question:
            - Decompose the question into smaller, more manageable parts.
            - Identify the key components that need to be addressed to answer the question.
        2. Gathering Information:
            - Seek out diverse sources of information.
            - Look for both quantitative data and qualitative insights.
            - Stay updated on relevant news and expert analyses.
        3. Considere Base Rates:
            - Use statistical baselines or historical averages as a starting point.
            - Compare the current situation to similar past events to establish a benchmark probability.
        4. Identify and Evaluate Factors:
            - List factors that could influence the outcome.
            - Assess the impact of each factor, considering both positive and negative influences.
            - Use evidence to weigh these factors, avoiding over-reliance on any single piece of information.
        5. Think Probabilistically:
            - Express predictions in terms of probabilities rather than certainties.
            - Assign likelihoods to different outcomes and avoid binary thinking.
            - Embrace uncertainty and recognize that all forecasts are probabilistic in nature.
        
        Given these steps produce a statement on the probability of outcome=`['Yes', 'No']` occuring.

        Give your response in the following format:

        I believe Court temporarily allows Texas to arrest migrants? has a likelihood `<class 'float'>` for outcome of `<class 'str'>`.
        

result:  I believe Court temporarily allows Texas to arrest migrants? has a likelihood `0.3` for outcome of `Yes`.
